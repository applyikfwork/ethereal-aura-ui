# 🚀 Aura AI Avatar Creator - Quick Start Guide

## ✅ What's Already Working

Your app is now fully configured and running with:

- ✅ **All API Keys Configured**: Supabase and Gemini API keys are active
- ✅ **Frontend Environment**: `.env` file properly loaded by Vite
- ✅ **Backend Ready**: Express server running with all routes
- ✅ **Beautiful UI**: All pages (Home, Studio, Gallery, Profile, Premium) are working
- ✅ **No Errors**: Supabase authentication is properly initialized

## 🔐 About Authentication

When you click **"Sign In"**, here's what happens:

1. **Google OAuth Flow**: The app attempts to sign you in with Google
2. **Supabase Handles It**: Supabase manages the entire authentication process
3. **Redirect Back**: After signing in with Google, you'll be redirected back to the app

### ⚠️ To Make Sign In Actually Work:

You need to configure Google OAuth in your Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ahbocxzrwnslhgbotrdz
2. Click **Authentication** → **Providers**
3. Find **Google** and enable it
4. Follow the guide to set up OAuth credentials in Google Cloud Console
5. Add your redirect URI: `https://ahbocxzrwnslhgbotrdz.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`

**Without this setup**: Clicking "Sign In" will redirect to Supabase, but Google OAuth won't work yet.

## 📊 Database Setup (Required for Data Persistence)

Currently, your app uses **in-memory storage** (data disappears when server restarts). To make it permanent:

### Step 1: Run the SQL Commands

1. Open https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ahbocxzrwnslhgbotrdz
2. Go to **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
3. Copy the entire content of `supabase_setup.sql`
4. Paste and click **Run**

This creates:
- `users` table with credits and premium fields
- `avatars` table with all customization options
- Security policies (RLS) to protect user data
- Indexes for better performance

### Step 2: Create Storage Bucket

1. In Supabase Dashboard → **Storage**
2. Click **"New Bucket"**
3. Name: `avatars`
4. Make it **Public**
5. Click **Create**

This is where generated avatar images will be stored.

## 🎨 How to Test the App

### 1. Browse the Landing Page
Just load the homepage - it works perfectly!

### 2. Explore the Studio
Click **"Studio"** or **"Create My Aura"** to see all the customization options:
- Gender, Age, Skin Tone
- Hair Style & Color
- Outfit, Background
- Art Style (Realistic, Anime, Fantasy, Cartoon, Cyberpunk)
- Aura Effects
- Resolution

### 3. Try Generating an Avatar (After Database Setup)
1. Configure authentication (see above)
2. Sign in with Google
3. Customize your avatar in the Studio
4. Click **"Generate Avatar"**
5. Wait for AI to create 4 variations
6. Download or save to your profile

### 4. Check the Gallery
Browse community avatars (once people start sharing theirs)

### 5. View Premium Features
Click **"Premium"** to see Aura+ membership benefits

## 🔧 Files You Need to Know

- **`supabase_setup.sql`** - Complete database schema (run this in Supabase)
- **`SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`** - Detailed step-by-step instructions
- **`client/.env`** - Frontend environment variables (already configured)
- **Replit Secrets** - Backend API keys (already configured)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Sign In doesn't work"
→ Configure Google OAuth in Supabase (see Authentication section above)

### "Generated avatars don't save"
→ Run the SQL commands to create database tables

### "Can't upload images"
→ Create the 'avatars' storage bucket in Supabase

### "App won't load"
→ Check that `client/.env` exists and has both Supabase variables

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Run SQL Commands** → Enable database persistence
2. **Create Storage Bucket** → Allow image uploads
3. **Configure Google OAuth** → Enable sign-in
4. **Test Avatar Generation** → Try creating your first AI avatar!

## 🎉 You're Ready!

Your Aura AI Avatar Creator is now configured and ready for development. The beautiful glassmorphic UI is live, all APIs are connected, and you just need to complete the database setup to start generating AI avatars!
