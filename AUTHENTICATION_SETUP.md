## Option 1: Enable Google Sign-In (Recommended)

Google OAuth provides a smooth, secure sign-in experience. Here's how to set it up:

### Step 1: Configure Google OAuth in Supabase

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: `ahbocxzrwnslhgbotrdz`
3. Navigate to **Authentication** ‚Üí **Providers** (left sidebar)
4. Find **Google** in the list and toggle it **ON**

### Step 2: Create Google OAuth Credentials

1. Go to **Google Cloud Console**: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Create a new project (or select an existing one)
3. Go to **APIs & Services** ‚Üí **Credentials**
4. Click **CREATE CREDENTIALS** ‚Üí **OAuth client ID**
5. Choose **Web application**
6. Add these to **Authorized redirect URIs**:
   ```
   https://ahbocxzrwnslhgbotrdz.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
   ```
7. Click **Create** and copy your:
   - **Client ID**
   - **Client Secret**

### Step 3: Add Credentials to Supabase

1. Back in Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí **Authentication** ‚Üí **Providers** ‚Üí **Google**
2. Paste your **Client ID**
3. Paste your **Client Secret**
4. Click **Save**

### Step 4: Test It Out

1. Refresh your Aura app
2. Click **Sign In**
3. You'll be redirected to Google
4. Choose your Google account
5. You'll be redirected back to the app, now signed in!

## Option 2: Use Email/Password (Alternative)

If you prefer email/password authentication instead of Google:

### Enable Email Auth in Supabase

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí **Authentication** ‚Üí **Providers**
2. Ensure **Email** is enabled (it usually is by default)
3. Configure email templates if needed

### Update the App UI

The app currently shows only the "Sign In" button for Google OAuth. To add email/password:

1. You can add a sign-up form to the app
2. Or I can help you create a dedicated login page with email/password fields

---

## Testing Authentication Without OAuth Setup

If you want to test the app without setting up OAuth right now, you can:

1. Use the **Studio** page directly (no login required for UI)
2. Note: Generating avatars will require authentication since it needs to track user credits

---

## How Sign-In Works Now

When you click **Sign In**:

**Without OAuth Setup:**
- The app will redirect you to Supabase's auth page
- You'll see a Google login screen
- But it will show an error because OAuth isn't configured yet

**With OAuth Setup:**
- The app redirects you to Google
- You authorize the app
- You're redirected back, fully signed in
- Your profile, credits, and avatars are tracked

---

## Quick Test

Want to see if it's working? Try this:

1. Click the **Sign In** button
2. If you see a Google login page (even with an error), it means Supabase is connected! ‚úÖ
3. The error means you just need to complete the OAuth setup above

---

## Need Help?

If you run into any issues:

1. Check the browser console for errors (F12)
2. Verify your Supabase URL and keys are correct
3. Make sure the redirect URI in Google Cloud matches exactly:
   `https://ahbocxzrwnslhgbotrdz.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`

---

## Summary

Your authentication is **95% complete**! Just need to:
1. Set up Google OAuth credentials in Google Cloud Console (5 minutes)
2. Add them to Supabase (1 minute)
3. Test and you're done! üéâ

The app is now production-ready for authentication once OAuth is configured.
